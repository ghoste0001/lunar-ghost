# Eclipsera Engine
Eclipsera Engine is a modified version of LunarEngine, designed to include features that the original project currently lacks. This engine is built using ROBLOX LuaU and aims to support the full range of Roblox APIs for game development.

The project is still in its early stages and actively under development.
## Is Eclipsera Engine Open Source?
Yes. Since this is a modification of the open-source LunarEngine, Eclipsera Engine is also open source and freely available for everyone to use.

---

## Compatibility
Eclipsera Engine is currently in its demo phase as LunarEngine, implementing a limited but functional subset of its intended API. While it's not feature-complete, it already supports a wide range of basic engine functionality enough to begin experimenting with rendering, scripting, and basic scene construction.
### Scene Rendering
- Basic scene rendering is functional, enabling real-time visualization of 3D environments.
- Includes lighting system support, featuring:
- - `[Ambient lighting]:` Simulates overall light presence in a scene.
- - `[Shadows]:` Dynamic or static, depending on lighting settings.
- - `[Skybox rendering]:` Background visuals to create atmospheric depth.
- Supports rendering of objects parented under `game.Workspace`, including `BasePart` instances.
- Basic camera control is implemented, allowing for simple navigation or player view movement.
Currently still uses the LunarEngine `"Libre-1"` rendering pipeline
### Instance & Object System
- Supports nearly the full Instance API, modeled after Roblox‚Äôs architecture.
- Exceptions: Currently missing :WaitForChild() support.
- Key instance methods and properties available:
- - `.Parent` (for parenting to hierarchies)
- - `:Destroy()`, `:Clone()` (object lifecycle control)
### Part Implementation
- Fully supports BasePart creation via
```lua
Instance.new("Part")
```
- Property support includes:
- - `[Visuals]:` `BasePart.Color`, `BasePart.Transparency`
- - `[Size and positioning]:` `BasePart.Size`, `BasePart.Position`, `BasePart.CFrame`
> Future updates will add support for other instance types like `Model`, `MeshPart`, `Decal`, etc.
### Core Data Types & Globals
- Implements support for key standard data types: `CFrame`, `Vector3`, `Color3`, Random`
- Core global objects and services: `game`, `script`, `workspace` are usable
- `game:GetService()` for service retrieval is functional
### Lighting System
The Lighting service is partially implemented, supporting real-time ambient and environmental adjustments:
- `Lighting.Ambient` ‚Äî sets global light tint
- `ighting.ShadowSoftness` ‚Äî adjusts the contrast and blur of shadows
- `Lighting.ClockTime` ‚Äî simulates in-game time of day
- `Lighting.Brightness` ‚Äî controls scene brightness
These can be dynamically changed at runtime and affect all visible objects.
## RunService & Render Pipeline
- Full support for the five standard RunService stages: `RenderStepped`, `Heartbeat`, `Stepped`, etc.
Allows connections and waits:
```lua
- RunService.RenderStepped:Connect(function...)
- RunService.RenderStepped:Wait()
```
- Scripts can be synchronized with these stages for frame-accurate updates.
### Program Execution Engine (Luau Support)
- Eclipse Engine includes strong support for Luau scripting, with several powerful features:
- Full support for:
- - `Scripts`, `LocalScripts`, `Coroutines`, `task.spawn`, `task.wait`, `task.delay`
- Custom task scheduler named Hyperball manages script execution efficiently
- - Prioritizes stable, non-blocking task management
- - Built-in support for signals and event-based programming
- Event handling via:
- - `RTScriptSignal`, `:Connect()`, `:Disconnect()` style listeners
- Optimized Luau runtime enabled by default for improved performance

## Current Features
- Separated shader files: `shaders/shaders.h` and `shaders/sky.h` have been split from `Renderer.cpp` for better organization.
- Basic support for the Roblox API, including `UserInputService`
> (that only service that LunarEngine doesn't have it rn, be patience, i will add more but might take a time, i'm no expert at cpp language lol)
- Early-stage support for GLSL shaders.
- Performance improvements, Fixed a crash issue in the Lua scheduler that occurred when loading large LuaU files.
> (Note: creating over 100,000 instances at once still causes crashes. this is currently a work in progress.)

## Roadmap üè≥
- Add a new instance/class called `Skybox`.
- Provide full GLSL shader support, along with legacy/basic post-processing options that can be used in the `LightingService` without requiring prior knowledge of GLSL.
- Implement an ImGUI-based debugging tool to support development. This will include access to an Explorer panel, Properties, memory usage stats, and hardware information.
- Rewrite LunarEngine‚Äôs ambient occlusion system using a modern technique, with customizable settings available through the `LightingService`.
- Improve camera controls: transition from keyboard arrow-based control to a more standard right mouse button handler.
